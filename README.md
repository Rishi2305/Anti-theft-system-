To many people, a motor vehicle is often the second largest investment they make during their lifetime, only behind a home or land. Vehicle theft in the form of hijacking and carjacking is a prevalent issue in many countries, such as the USA, New Zealand and South Africa. Carjacking is described as the theft of stationery cars that don't contain any passengers. Hijacking is defined as the theft of a vehicle with occupants. Statistics indicate that there are approximately 88,000 vehicles stolen in South Africa alone during 2019. This is concerning as oftentimes the vehicle's driver's life is put at risk as they are forced to step out of their vehicle at gun point. There are a few commercial solutions that try to tackle the carjacking aspect of vehicle theft by attaching passive immobilizers in a hidden spot of the vehicle. These immobilizers require the driver to deactivate them within a certain time period after the engine's ignition to prevent the vehicle from stalling. However, this solution is not effective in cases of hijacking as the immobilizer would already be deactivated by the driver. The prototype discussed in this wiki aims to be effective in both forms of vehicle theft.
